### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Clirim. I make websites. I'm creative, analytical, and passionate about web development. 

Computers,web design and programming have always fascinated me as I was playing with HTML when I was a kid.I knew that sometime in my life I would get back at it because I was sure that it is something that I would love.That turned out to be more than true and I'm enjoying coding more and more everyday.

Before transitioning into software development, I worked as a Customer Relationship Supervisor where I had the chance to learn great skills which now I apply in my current path as a developer. One important thing that I would highlight from my previous career is the importance of communication within the working groups and how that can lead to a great success.

Skills that I gained working on projects with the WBS coding school:
Languages: JavaScript(ES6),  Node.js 
Frameworks: React/Redux,  Bootstrap 5,
Databases: PostgreSQL, MongoDB
Softskills: Communication(verbal/written), teamwork, mentoring, leadership.

My goal is to provide solutions and help the world digitalise.
Looking forward to consolidating and improving my programming skills.
